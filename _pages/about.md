I am a Research Associate Professor in the Department of Robotics at [Tohoku University, Japan](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/). I obtained my Ph.D. in Human Mechanical Systems and Design Engineering from [Hokkaido University](https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/), Japan in 2015 majoring in `autonomous mobile robot navigation` and was a MEXT scholarship recepient from the government of Japan for my graduate studies from 2010-2015 (Masters and Doctoral). 

I was previously affiliated with School of Engineering at Hokkaido University, Japan where I was an Assistant Professor from 2015 to 2021. 

My research areas are in `mobile robot navigation`, `path planning`, `multi-robot systems`, and `probabilistic inferencing and scene understanding for mobile robots`. I am particularly interested in integrating intelligent service robots in healthcare scenarios by utilizing semantic inferencing at object level. I am currently working for the [Moonshot R&D program (Goal 3)](https://www.jst.go.jp/moonshot/en/program/goal3/) with Prof. Hirata and researching on the development of new assistive robot systems to support the aging population.
